1. IMDb Ratings vs. Percentage of Movies that Have Won Awards by Genres
The IMDb rating vs. movie genres illustration explores whether the films shot in Toronto since 2000 received similar ratings by IMDb users and the agencies. The original dataset contains 268 observations and 26 dimensions. I used Rstudio to clean up the data, and manually created the chart using Powerpoint. The graph allows viewers to get a sense of what genres are preferred by the IMDb viewers but may not be appreciated by the experts, and vice versa. For example, one may infer that the regular audiences and the professional media have the same taste in action movies filmed in Toronto since 2000, as the percentage of movies that have won awards increases from the low IMDb rating category to the high IMDb rating category. Moreover, the graph also illustrates which genre has the most awards in different rating ranges. In other words, one may find that drama movies shot in Toronto since 2000 have won more awards than other film genres that are rated below five on IMDb, suggesting those users have higher standards for drama films. Last but not least, viewers can quickly identify the range of IMDb ratings of a specific genre. For instance, thrillers' ratings are generally less than 5, indicating that thrillers are usually not welcomed by the public.
